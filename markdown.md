As a 'user' I want to be able to view my entire `employee directory` at once so that I have quick access to their `information`.

The user should be able to sort the `table` by at least one category, and filter the users by at least one property

## Objects
* User
* Employee Directory
* User Info
* Table
* Category
* Filter
* Property

## Components (there may be more than this...)
* Header/navbar
* Filter
* Table
  * Properties (the table headers)
  * Data (User records)
  *
